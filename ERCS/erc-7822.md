## Abstract

This proposal introduces the concept of a **Digital Decentralized Passport (DDP)**, designed to store personal information analogous to a traditional passport. The DDP includes fields for names, surnames, unique identifiers (e.g., residency or citizenship numbers), and optionally encrypted sensitive data. The passport integrates credibility points earned through social verification, endorsements from government representatives, and validations by certified organizations.

The DDP uses a multi-step verification process to establish trust and legitimacy, reflecting real-world laws and relationships. It has potential applications in voting systems, public tenders, and other scenarios requiring identity verification, aiming to mitigate fraud and increase accountability.

## Motivation

Identity fraud and unauthorized actions in critical systems (e.g., elections, corporate transactions) pose significant risks. A tamper-proof, traceable, and decentralized identity solution can address these issues. The **Digital Decentralized Passport** offers the following benefits:

1. **Fraud Prevention:** Makes identity forgery and unauthorized voting significantly more difficult.
2. **Traceability:** Fraudulent activities are visible and traceable, even if hacking occurs.
3. **Participation Verification:** Ensures voting legitimacy by confirming citizenship and eligibility without compromising vote anonymity.
4. **Integration:** Can include digital signatures for contracts, citizenship status, document details, official photos, and last activity indicators to verify an individual’s activity and existence.

## Definitions

- **Digital Decentralized Passport (DDP):** A blockchain-based digital representation of an individual’s identity, validated by multiple authorities.
- **Unique Identifier:** A country-specific or organization-specific number used to distinguish citizens or members (e.g., national ID, passport number).
- **Credibility Points:** A decentralized metric representing trustworthiness based on social and administrative validations.
- **Social Verification:** Confirmation of identity through connections and interactions within a decentralized network.
- **Administrative Validation:** Verification provided by government or certified entities.

## Specification

### Structure
The DDP will be implemented as a standardized ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) with the following structure:

#### Passport Fields
1. **Basic Information:**
   - `firstName`: String
   - `lastName`: String
   - `birthDate`: Timestamp
   - `nationality`: String (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code)
   - `uniqueIdentifier`: String (encrypted or plain)

2. **Verification Data:**
   - `credibilityScore`: Integer (cumulative score from verifications)
   - `verifiers`: Array (list of addresses of verifying entities)
   - `verificationTimestamps`: Array (timestamps of verifications)

3. **Activity Indicators:**
   - `lastActivity`: Timestamp
   - `digitalSignature`: Array (hashes of signed documents or agreements)

4. **Optional Fields:**
   - `profilePhoto`: IPFS hash or equivalent decentralized storage reference.
   - `citizenshipHistory`: Array (records of citizenship changes).

### Verification Process
1. **Multi-Step Verification:**
   - Initial data is provided by the individual.
   - Verified by:
     - Social Network (trusted peers sign off).
     - Government or Organization (certified representatives sign off).
   - Verification hashes are stored on-chain for traceability.

2. **Credibility Points:**
   - Points are earned based on:
     - Number of verifiers.
     - Weight of the verifier (e.g., government entities > individual peers).

### Use Cases
1. **Voting Systems:**
   - Ensure only eligible citizens vote without linking votes to identities.

2. **Tenders and Contracts:**
   - Validate identity before bidding or signing agreements.

3. **Proof of Life:**
   - Activity indicators demonstrate recent interaction, reducing risks of fraud.

### Smart Contract Methods

#### `registerPassport`
- **Inputs:**
  - `firstName` (string)
  - `lastName` (string)
  - `birthDate` (timestamp)
  - `uniqueIdentifier` (string, encrypted)
  - `profilePhoto` (optional, IPFS hash)
- **Outputs:**
  - `passportId` (unique on-chain ID)

#### `verifyPassport`
- **Inputs:**
  - `passportId` (unique ID)
  - `verifier` (address)
  - `signature` (hash)
- **Outputs:**
  - `credibilityScore` (updated score)

#### `updateActivity`
- **Inputs:**
  - `passportId` (unique ID)
  - `activityTimestamp` (timestamp)
- **Outputs:**
  - Updated `lastActivity`

#### `getPassport`
- **Inputs:**
  - `passportId` (unique ID)
- **Outputs:**
  - All fields associated with the passport.

### Security Considerations
1. **Privacy:** Ensure sensitive data (e.g., unique identifiers) can be encrypted.
2. **Tamper Resistance:** Use blockchain immutability to secure verification history.
3. **Anonymity in Voting:** Maintain vote secrecy while confirming eligibility.

## Appendix: Example Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DigitalDecentralizedPassport {
    struct Passport {
        string firstName;
        string lastName;
        uint256 birthDate;
        string nationality;
        string uniqueIdentifier;
        uint256 credibilityScore;
        address[] verifiers;
        uint256[] verificationTimestamps;
        uint256 lastActivity;
        string profilePhoto;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Passport) public passports;
    mapping(address => bool) public trustedVerifiers;
    uint256 public passportCounter;

    modifier onlyTrustedVerifier() {
        require(trustedVerifiers[msg.sender], "Not a trusted verifier");
        _;
    }

    function registerPassport(
        string memory firstName,
        string memory lastName,
        uint256 birthDate,
        string memory nationality,
        string memory uniqueIdentifier,
        string memory profilePhoto
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        passportCounter++;
        passports[passportCounter] = Passport(
            firstName,
            lastName,
            birthDate,
            nationality,
            uniqueIdentifier,
            0,
            new address[](0),
            new uint256 ,
            block.timestamp,
            profilePhoto
        );
        return passportCounter;
    }

    function addTrustedVerifier(address verifier) public {
        trustedVerifiers[verifier] = true;
    }

    function removeTrustedVerifier(address verifier) public {
        trustedVerifiers[verifier] = false;
    }

    function verifyPassport(uint256 passportId, address verifier) public onlyTrustedVerifier {
        Passport storage passport = passports[passportId];
        passport.verifiers.push(verifier);
        passport.verificationTimestamps.push(block.timestamp);
        passport.credibilityScore += 1; // Simplified scoring mechanism
    }

    function updateActivity(uint256 passportId) public {
        Passport storage passport = passports[passportId];
        passport.lastActivity = block.timestamp;
    }
}
```

This implementation demonstrates a basic structure for the **Digital Decentralized Passport**, which can be extended to meet additional requirements.
